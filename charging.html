          <p>With FordPass, I was completely involved with my team through the entire thing - from defining problems to scoping down the work, executing visual designs, and working with engineers to polish the final product. The team included me as a designer, four iOS engineers, a product manager, and a researcher who worked cross-teams.</p>

              <p> Over the course of a couple of months, I led the design with a researcher. I prototyped the new charging experience that would allow the users to monitor and manage their vehicle's charge through the application. </p>

                <p>As Ford entered into the EV market with Mach-E, the opportunities also increased with FordPass to manage and customize the Mach-E's charging needs. Monitoring the charge status and customizing it - is essential for an electric vehicle, but building on top of the existing application designed for fuel vehicles was challenging.</p>
                <p>Problems with the initial concept:</p>
                <ol class="pl3">
                  <li class="pl3 mv3">Finding the Charging section was unintuitive as the users initially searched for the information elsewhere.</li>

                  Our goal was to create a simple application that would make FordPass appealing to the Mach-E owners, and ultimately have them use it to manage their vehicle's charging sessions. The primary metrics that measured how valuable the feature would be were:

                  <li class="pl3 mv3">Percentage of people using the app to manage and customize the vehicle charging sessions</li>

                <p>I explored a few original workflows for the user stories based on the problems we found. We tried to pare it down to the essential workflows for an MVP.</p>
                <p>As someone who bought the new Mach-E, I want to plug my vehicle to the charging station and see the detailed charging progress anywhere from FordPass application.</p>

              <p>From there, we broke down the components that would be required to fulfil these workflows. First was the charging screen â€” a place to manage and customize the new Mach-E's charging capabilities. The idea was to have an intuitive flow to engage the user.</p>

            <p>We created the Charging Status card to be scalable to show the information in different modes - when the vehicle is plugged and charging, and when it is a scheduled to charge. The card also shows the departure time and cabin comfort level if provided.
